\chapter{Introduction}
 1.1. What is stock market prediction?
 
 A stock market prediction is an attempt to forecast the future value of an individual stock, a particular sector or the market, or the market as a whole. These forecasts generally use fundamental analysis of a company or economy, or technical analysis of charts, or combination of the two.\\
 
 1.2. What is stock marketing.

Stock market is one of the major fields that investors are dedicated to, thus stock market price trend
prediction is always a hot topic for researchers from both financial and technical domains. In this
research, our objective is to build a state-of-art prediction model for price trend prediction, which
focuses on short-term price trend prediction.
As concluded by Fama in , financial time series prediction is known to be a notoriously difficult task
due to the generally accepted, semi-strong form of market efficiency and the high level of noise.
Back in 2003, Wang et al. in already applied artificial neural networks on stock market price
prediction and focused on volume, as a specific feature of stock market. One of the key findings by
them was that the volume was not found to be effective in improving the forecasting performance on
the datasets they used, which was S&P 500 and DJI. Ince and Trafalis in targeted short-term
forecasting and applied support vector machine (SVM) model on the stock price prediction. Their
main contribution is performing a comparison between multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and SVM then
found that most of the scenarios SVM outperformed MLP, while the result was also affected by
different trading strategies. In the meantime, researchers from financial domains were applying
conventional statistical methods and signal processing techniques on analyzing stock market data.
The optimization techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) were also applied in shortterm stock price prediction. During the years, researchers are not only focused on stock price-related
analysis but also tried to analyze stock market transactions such as volume burst risks, which
expands the stock market analysis research domain broader and indicates this research domain still
has high potential. As the artificial intelligence techniques evolved in recent years, many proposed
solutions attempted to combine machine learning and deep learning techniques based on previous
approaches, and then proposed new metrics that serve as training features such as Liu and Wang.
This type of previous works belongs to the feature engineering domain and can be considered as the
inspiration of feature extension ideas in our research. Liu et al. in proposed a convolutional neural
network (CNN) as well as a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network based model to analyze
different quantitative strategies in stock markets. The CNN serves for the stock selection strategy,
automatically extracts features based on quantitative data, then follows an LSTM to preserve the
time-series features for improving profits.
The latest work also proposes a similar hybrid neural network architecture, integrating a
convolutional neural network with a bidirectional long short-term memory to predict the stock
market index [4]. While the researchers frequently proposed different neural network solution. \\

\chapter{Literature Review}
2.1 Paper Surveys

"What other people think” has always been an important piece of information for most of us during the decision-making process. The Internet and the Web have now (among other things) made it possible to find out about the opinions and experiences of those in the vast pool of people that are neither our personal acquaintances nor well-known professional critics — that is, people we have never heard of. And conversely, more and more people are making their opinions available to strangers via the Internet. The interest that individual users show in online opinions about products and services, and the potential influence such opinions wield, is something that is driving force for this area of interest. And there are many challenges involved in this process which needs to be walked all over in order to attain proper
outcomes out of them. In this survey we analysed basic methodology that usually happens in this process and measures that are to be taken to overcome the challenges being faced.

2. AI To Predict Price Movements in the Stock Market 

This paper presents a study on how to integrate recurrent neural networks in creating an algorithm that can
predict stock market price changes. Trading in the stock market can be overwhelming due to its volatility in price changes. As a result, traders become indecisive and can miss several gaining opportunities offered by the market. The dataset for this research includes existing historical price data of the Philippine Stock Exchange index, which comprises the weighted mean of the top 30 publicly traded companies in the Philippines. 
The dataset is utilized for creating the predictor model using recurrent neural network algorithms. 
The researchers constructed a model that can potentially help forecast future price movements
of the stock index by dividing the datasets for testing and training, and by using regressions and long shortterm memory network (LSTM). 
This research is beneficial not only to the academic community but will also bring great value to the traders and investors of different markets.
 Ashkan Safari, Amir Aminzadeh Ghavifekr. International Stock Index Prediction Using Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) and Python Programming.
The stock market is one of the best channels for financial development that requires a high accuracy
prediction of the trades. This subject needs some technical skills and experience to achieve the best result.
This paper represents a tuned Python console program based on the Neural Network (NN), and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict future price in a qualified and quantized way with high accuracy and close to real. New ideas implemented in this paper are combining AI and NN model in the Python console
system with a security shell that works with voice and PIN to authenticate the user. It has Cross-Platform
capability and supports cryptocurrencies price and their predictions. This program enables the user to have a duplication of the final data in his/her given email.
The proposed approach presents the influence of AI
and Machine learning in nearly future predictions. 
This system can be used in the all kinds of subjects that
include past time databases.

\chapter{Working}
\section{How Does Stock Market Prediction Works?}\\
In this section, we present the proposed methods and the design of the proposed solution. Moreover,
we also introduce the architecture design as well as algorithmic and implementation details.
Stock price analysis has been a critical area of research and is one of the top applications of machine
learning. This tutorial will teach you how to perform stock price prediction using machine
learning and deep learning techniques. Here, you will use an LSTM network to train your model with Google stocks data.\\

	\caption{ANN Architecture}
	\label{net2}
\end{figure}\\



\section{Long Short Term Memory (LSTM):-}
LSTM is a form of recurrent neural network that addresses sequential problems.the network model is created by building several layers for the LSTM structure.\\
The variation can be used to solve
multiple complex problems, including the prediction of patterns based from the input data of the
sequence over time to achieve a high prediction accuracy.
Backpropagation in neural networks is an algorithm that computes the gradient of a model’s error
function, with consideration on its weights. The order for the gradient’s computation starts from the
last layer and ends with the first most layer, representing a backward process. Although the
algorithm is widely used in neural networks, it has the tendency to produce lags during the process,
most likely due to deficient and decaying error backflow. For this reason, one of the main purposes
of LSTM is to avoid the lag time, giving the system a faster processing time. LSTM RNN is known
to be more effective over other forms of neural network combination algorithms. A sample of the
LSTM RNN architecture is shown as follows.\\

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{kkl (2).jpg}
	\caption{LSTM Architecture.}
	\label{net2}
\end{figure}\\

\section{ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}
The implementation of the RNN-LSTM approach is seen to be a success (Figure 6). The model was
trained using 100 epochs with 24 data per batch. By visual analysis, the predicted model contains
almost the same trends as the real model. Upon further analysis, two problems can be seen here. The
first one is the price fall at around the 50th index wherein the predicted model projected around
5000 while the real price is much lower at 4000. The second one is at the end of the graphs where
the real stock prices are projecting a rise while the predicted stock prices are projecting the opposite.
A lot can go wrong with this as being informed of a false positive may cause a big loss for investors.
From the figure, it can also be seen that a lot of the points contain values that were over-predicted,
which is supported by the negative percent error. Having MPEs less than zero implies overprediction of values as it can only turn negative when a significant number of predicted values are
more than their true value counterparts. For this case, the values predicted are approximately 3.58%
above the true values. This is not much of a problem as it can be seen by visual inspection that this
overshoot is consistent throughout many different points. This means that further tweaking and
optimization on the code can adjust the predicted points downwards without compromising the
validity of the study

\chapter{Applications}
The stock market prediction has attracted much attention from academia as well as business. Due to
the non-linear, volatile and complex nature of the market, it is quite difficult to predict. As the stock
markets grow bigger, more investors pay attention to develop a systematic approach to predict the
stock market. Since the stock market is very sensitive to the external information, the performance
of previous prediction systems is limited by merely considering the traditional stock data. New
forms of collective intelligence have emerged with the rise of the Internet (e.g. Google Trends,
Wikipedia, etc.). The changes on these platforms will significantly affect the stock market. In
addition, both the financial news sentiment and volumes are believed to have an impact on the stock
price. In this study, disparate data sources are used to generate a prediction model along with a
comparison of different machine learning methods. Besides historical data directly from the stock
market, numbers of external data sources are also considered as inputs to the model. The goal of this
study is to develop and evaluate a decision-making system that could be used to predict stocks’ short
term movement, trend, and price. We took advantage of the open source API and public economic
database which allow us to explore the hidden information among these platforms. The prediction
models are compared and evaluated using machine learning techniques, such as neural network,
support vector regression and boosted tree. Numbers of case studies are performed to evaluate the
performance of the prediction system.

using Machine Learning Techniques [3].
Stock market price prediction is one of the favourite research topics under consideration for professionals
from various fields like mathematics, statistics, history, finance, computer science engineering etc., as it
requires a set of skills to predict variation of price of shares in a very volatile and challenging share market
scenario. Share market trading is mostly dependent on sentiments of investors and other factors like
economic policies, political changes, natural disasters etc., Many theories were forwarded, mathematical
and statistical applications in conjunction with probability, to simplify the complex process. After the
advent of computers, it got further simplified but still challenging due to various external influential factors
ruling the volatility of the market prices. Thus, AI and ML algorithms were being developed, but for only
for next day using Linear Regression procedures.
architectures, it brought further discussions about the topic if the high cost of training such models is
worth the result or not.

There are three key contributions of our work

(1) A new dataset extracted and cleansed.

(2) A comprehensive feature engineering.

(3) A customized long short-term memory (LSTM) based deep learning model

\subsection{Future Scope}
Stock market prediction means determining the future scope of market. A system is essential to
be built which will work with maximum accuracy and it should consider all important factors that
could influence the result. Various researches have already been done to predict stock market prices \\
The use of these fundamental elements of depends not only on the area being studied, but the knowledge of the analyst has of the study area. For example the texture of an object is also very useful in distinguishing objects that may appear the same if the judging solely on tone (i.e., water and tree canopy, may have the same mean brightness values, but their texture is much different. Association is a very powerful image analysis tool when coupled with the general knowledge of the site. Thus we are adept at applying collateral data and personal knowledge to the task of image processing. With the combination of multi-concept of examining remotely sensed data in multispectral, multitemporal, multiscales and in conjunction with multidisciplinary, allows us to make a verdict not only as to what an object is but also its importance. Apart from these analog image processing techniques also includes optical photogrammetric techniques allowing for precise measurement of the height, width, location, etc. of an object.
Digital Image Processing involves a collection of techniques for the manipulation of digital images by computers. Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be modeled in the form of Multidimensional Systems.\\
   In a most generalized way, a digital image is an array of numbers depicting spatial distribution of a certain field parameters (such as reflectivity of EM radiation, emissivity, temperature or some geophysical or topographical elevation. Digital image consists of discrete picture elements called pixels. Associated with each pixel is a number represented as DN (Digital Number), that depicts the average radiance of relatively small area within a scene. The range of DN values being normally 0 to 255. The size of this area effects the reproduction of details within the scene. As the pixel size is reduced more scene detail is preserved           \\                                                                                       
Remote sensing images are recorded in digital forms and then processed by the computers to produce images for interpretation purposes. Images are available in two forms - photographic film form and digital form. Variations in the scene characteristics are represented as variations in brightness on photographic films. A particular part of scene reflecting more energy will appear bright while a different part of the same scene that reflecting less energy will appear black. Digital image consists of discrete picture elements called pixels. Associated with each pixel is a number represented as DN (Digital Number), that depicts the average radiance of relatively small area within a scene. The size of this area effects the reproduction of details within the scene. As the pixel size is reduced more scene detail is preserved in digital representation.\\

\chapter{Conclusion}
We have successfully implemented machine learning algorithms on the dataset for predicting the stock
market price. We applied data preprocessing and feature selection on the dataset. We applied four
algorithms: KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression on the dataset. We analyzed the difference
of the algorithms by calculating the performance metrics (accuracy, Recall, precision, f-score). We also
found the advantages and disadvantages of the algorithms. We conclude that Random Forest is the best
algorithm out of the four with an accuracy rate of 80.7%. Future scope of this paper would be adding more
parameters that effect the stock market prediction. Adding more number of parameters will ensure better
estimation\\
